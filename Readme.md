# Wake Me When

- Wake Me When is a smart meeting filtering and alert system designed to reduce unnecessary interruptions for busy professionals.
- It helps users avoid non-essential meetings that often waste time, lower productivity, and disrupt work-life balance.
- The system filters meetings based on:
  - Whether the meeting is marked as “High Importance”
  - Presence of critical keywords like “Urgent” or “Attention” in the subject or description
  - Whether the user is listed explicitly as a required attendee (in the "To" field)
  - Whether the meeting is scheduled outside the user’s defined working hours
- Only meetings that truly need the user’s attention are surfaced or notified, helping users stay focused and avoid alert fatigue.
